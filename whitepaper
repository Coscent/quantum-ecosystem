# Quantum Ecosystem Computing: A New Paradigm

## Abstract

We propose a radically new model of quantum computation, where the system is not a machine, but a self-organizing semantic ecosystem. In this model:

- Noise is not an error, but a resource.
- Computation is not deterministic, but emergent.
- Meaning arises from quantum superpositions.
- AI is not a tool, but a cognitive co-author.

This whitepaper outlines the conceptual, mathematical, and architectural foundations of this approach.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional quantum computing treats decoherence and noise as enemies. We invert this logic: noise becomes the medium of emergence. Inspired by biological systems, we model computation as an evolving ecosystem of quantum impulses.
